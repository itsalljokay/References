# References
References and documentation for itsalljokay's public repositories.

## Hey, You!
This is where I store all my references and documentation for my public projects. You're more than welcome to poke around to see how I arrived at the methods I did. I've also included my development process for my projects, as a reminder of things Jessi first starting out could have used.
